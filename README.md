# Performance-an-Electric-Car
In this project, we will be analyzing data on the performance of electric cars to identify which models and brands offer the best performance in terms of factors such as range, efficiency, and acceleration. Using Python, we will clean, preprocess, and analyze this data to identify trends and patterns in the performance of different electric car models and brands. We will use statistical analysis and data visualization techniques to compare the performance of different models and identify which models offer the best performance in various categories.

Finally, we will use Tableau to create interactive dashboards and reports that allow users to explore the performance data for different electric car models and brands. This will enable users to compare the performance of different models and make more informed decisions when selecting an electric car. The insights gained from this analysis can also be used by car manufacturers to improve the performance and efficiency of their electric vehicles.
